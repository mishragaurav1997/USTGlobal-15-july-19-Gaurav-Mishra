  description:'Temper the milk before adding it to the soup by gradually adding small amounts of the hot liquid, warming the milk slowly; then add it to the soup. Add a little heavy cream to the soup to help prevent curdling. In milk-based soups, add acidic ingredients, such as tomatoes and lemon juice, to the milk mixture. Do not add the milk to the acidic ingredients.  Make a thin flour and water paste to mix into the milk before adding acidic ingredients. Thickening the soup with a flour mixture keeps the soup from curdling so easily.Avoid using low-fat and skim milk. The more fat the milk contains the less chance of curdling.Heat milk to 194 degrees F. before adding it to the soup. Do not boil.Heat all cream based soups slowly over low heat. Salt should be added just before the soup is ready to serve.'
